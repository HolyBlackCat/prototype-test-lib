This is a WIP testing framework, nothing to see here yet.

**T**aut is **a** **u**nit **t**est framework[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) for modern C++. It prioritizes having a clean API (exactly one way of doing things) and good diagnostics, and uses a new kind of assertion syntax.

## Usage

### Debugging tips

#### CodeLLDB

* Set "Disassembly" to "never" (on the bottom panel, or `"lldb.showDisassembly": "never",` in `settings.json`), to avoid manually having to skip uninteresting assembly stack frames.
* Disable `on throw` and `on catch` in 'Breakpoints' to only break on uncaught exceptions.

### Platform quirks

* **MSYS2** â€” The default font in MinTTY (`Lucida Console`) seems to render box drawing characters poorly. Switch to something like `Cascadia Mono` for better results.

* **Wine** â€” Wine can't handle unicode and ANSI escape sequences. Piping output through `| cat` seems to fix that, or run with `--no-color --no-unicode`.

* **MacOS** â€” Debugger detection code is missing. If you want to break on failure, you need to pass `--break` manually.

   âœ¨ Help wanted! If you have a Mac and want to fix this, be my guest.

* **Old Windows** â€” Colored output requires Windows 10 or newer (to support ANSI escape sequences). Older versions also might have issues with unicode characters. If something doesn't work, run with `--no-color --no-unicode`.
